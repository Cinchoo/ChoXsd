# Cinchoo - XSD GUI Tool
GUI interface to Microsoft Xsd tool

Microsoft has a nifty little tool called xsd.exe which lets you create serializable classes for the .NET framework from an XSD or XML file. Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t come with the latest versions of Visual Studio and you have to download the Windows SDK to get hold of it.

This article presents the new Cinchoo GUI interface to xsd.exe tool to parse XML documents and generate entities. This new interface is built using Cinchoo framework, using most of its features like Configuration, Command line parsing, Application host, binding to controls, etc. This is one of the working examples of building an application using this versatile .NET framework easily.
